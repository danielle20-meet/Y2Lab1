## HTML, CSS & GIT Review - Lab (Yearlong 2019/20)

Welcome back to the yearlong Y2s! It's going to be awesome (I promise).
This lab has been created to refresh your memory and make sure you're still good in HTML, CSS and Git :P
<br/>Let's start! 

**First things first, *fork* this repo(sitory) and *clone* it to your desktop!**

## HTML Section ##
1. Create a file "hello.html".<br/> Open the 'hello.html' file using a browser (Like Chrome/Firefox), the page should be empty.<br/><br/> 
2. Make your page stand out!<br/> To do that change it to be about a topic that you’re interested in,<br/> your page should have the following (doesn’t have to be in order):<br/>
> -- Add/change the title of your page <br/> -- A body tag <br/> -- A paragraph inside the body <br/> -- An h1 tag inside the body <br/> -- An h2 tag inside the body.<br/><br/>


3. Add an image.<br/> In the same hello.html file, add an image related to the topic you wrote about. **Set the width to 400px**.<br/><br/>
4. Add a link.<br/>
Add a link to the Wikipedia page about the animal or the topic you're interested in.
<br/><br/>

## CSS Section ##

1. Use the Tag selector to change the background of your HTML page to your favorite color.<br/>
2. Use an ID selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>
A property could be: font-size, border, color, etc...<br/>

3. Use a class selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>

<br/>

## Git Section ## 
Commit and push your changes.<br/>
To do that, remember you should:<br/>
```
git add .
git commit -m "added hello.html. I am a pro!"
git push
```

## Bonus Section ##
If you have finished and still have time, first of all **GOOD JOB!** - Secondly,<br/>
You can now customize your page as much as you want. If you remember our **CSS Tips and Tricks** from the summer you could do a lot of cool stuff (psstt... I love animations!)
